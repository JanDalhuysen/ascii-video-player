# ASCII Video Player

## Description
This project decodes a video file and converts it to raw RGB pixel data. It then converts each RGB pixel to an ASCII character based on its luminance (brightness) and colors the characters to match the original video colors. Finally, it outputs the frames at the original video's frame rate.

## Features
- Takes a video file that the user uploads
- Gets video dimensions and frame rate
- Calculates an appropriate size for the video
